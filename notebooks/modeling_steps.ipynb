    "Notes:\n",
    "WHO Diabetes Fact Sheet\n",
    "* Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas **does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces**. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. **Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar**, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels. \n",
    "* There are two types of diabetes - Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more common than Type 1 diabetes and often results from excess body weight and physical inactivity while Type 1 diabetes is independent on body size. Additionally, there is Gestational diabetes in which a woman without diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. The latter usually resolves after birth while the other two types of diabetes have to be treated in the longterm.\n",
    "* Around 8.5 % of the adult population is diagnosed with Diabetes independent of the gender.\n",
    "* Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period of time and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following:\n",
    "        * Fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)\n",
    "        * Plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load as in a glucose tolerance test\n",
    "        * Symptoms of high blood sugar and casual plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)\n",
    "        * Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5 DCCT %)\n",

    "# Data cleaning and preparation (possible steps, to be verified what is really needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Target correlates to BMI\n",
    "- Glucose related features are one of the most important features for diabetes detection\n",
    "- Target has minor correlation to blood pressure category (could indicate level of fitness)\n",
    "- Check if target is unbalanced\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "- Drop identifiers (encounter_id, hospital_id, icu_id)\n",
    "- ~Drop measurements taken in the first hour (h1...min/max) because high ratio of missing values and redundant with d1_...min/max columns~\n",
    "- ~Drop duplicates in blood pressure columns (invasive/noninvasive)~\n",
    "- Drop readmission status (readmission_status) because only one unique value\n",
    "- Drop 30 rows in training data with implausible age (0)\n",
    "- ~Drop paco2_for_ph_apache because it is identical to paco2_apache identical.~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Values\n",
    "- Merge ...apache to d1_...max and then drop ...apache column for albumin, bilirubin , bun, creatinine, glucose, hematocrit, sodium, wbc, and heart_rate\n",
    "- Weight and height filled with mean for gender\n",
    "- ~Fill the missing values of the Oxygenation index d1_pao2fio2ratio_max with pao2_apache/fio2_apache.~\n",
    "- Fill the missing values for gender with 'Unknown'\n",
    "- Fill the missing values for ethnicity with the already available value 'Other/Unknown'.\n",
    "- Use MICE to replace missing values in numerical columns\n",
    "- Use SingleImputer to replace missing values in categorical variables, strategy \"most frequent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Correlations to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "- Remove columns where missing values are more than 80% of the entire column, columns that have low correlation with target variable.\n",
    "- Remove columns that are visible correlated with other ones to avoid multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Drop BMI column because it can be derived from weight and height, I want to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "- BMI Categories (underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obese)\n",
    "- ~Range and Mean from d1 ... min/max~\n",
    "- ~Blood pressure categories from systolic and diastolic blood pressure~\n",
    "- One Hot Encode Categorical columns\n",
    "- Groups of tests that were taken\n",
    "- Note that h1 measurements were present, but not value\n",
    "- BMI AND ethnicity\n",
    "- hospital_admit_source, icu_admit_source: emergency yes or no \n",
    "- difference in glucose max d1, h1\n",
    "- scores from mdscore\n",
    "- has high risk diabetes comorbidity\n",

    "### Outlier removal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apply all preprocessing steps for unlabeled data\n",
